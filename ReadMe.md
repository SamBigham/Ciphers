The code is on Ceaser ciphers and Vigenere ciphers

code is written by Sam Bigham

The code with the name CaesarCipher.java does the Caesar Cipher, which takes in an input of encode/decode and a word, and returns all possible Ceasar encryptions/decryptions of the word. The VigenereCipher.java is similar, but it takes in a keyword too which is used to encrypt/decrypt the word.

I used stack overflow to help me figure out the documentation on some of the java commands, such as length, and (char)
I am also turning this in a second time as I have completed the suggestions on gradescope and changed file names in addition to changing variable names and refactoring a litte.
